[2022-May-04 23:11:48] Data: comment_text=Telos 

I have added Telos to the home planet section of the infobox (mentioning that it was adopted) several times now and each it has been removed by the cryon user:Edoktor. Telos ought definitely to be included there as is is a massive part of who history, two episodes being set on telos itself and based around the cybermen's exploits there and at least 6 episodes featuring telosian Cybermen (the Cybermen in general featured in 10, so it was more than half. Many Cybermen were created there, there was a large cyberconversion facility, thus most Cybermen, after the tenth planet destroyed most of them, originated there and that is where the cyber controller rules from there. Thus, it is definitely a cyber-home planet and I see no possible justification for not including it on the section of the infobox. I did reference the second time so this cannot have been the issue.

Thanks for your time,

My stance of being a ""Proud Nintendo 3DS Owner"" has absolutely nothing to do with me taking a neutral position or not in the discussed article. Or can't a video game journalist for example, not have his/her personal preferences and do unbiased journalism at the same time? As for the colour code, I advise you to read the entire conversation before going in to bold assumptions. Like I said in a previous post: ""Alright, this is getting out of control. You're getting this ""Yes/No template"" thing all wrong, seriously. Someone at my talk page said the following: ""To use an extreme example: ""Does the console kill people?"", the answer is ""No"", which is a positive."". So by your philosophy would you color it with green because it's a good thing? Wrong. No, consoles do not kill people and yes, it is POSITIVE, but this does not invalidate the fact that it still is something NEGATIVE related to the question. Even the the templates themselves have by default the green color for yes and the red color for no, and that must already  mean something by itself. The purpose of Wikipedia is objectivity, not subjectivity. But what the reader does with the information is entirely up to him. Which means that if he thinks that something positive/colored green is a negative thing for him, that's his problem. He can think whatever he wants of this information. I hope this clears things up."". To sum it up: Yes=Affirmative=Green / No=Negative=Red, personal preferences don't come into account. Again, as for the Vita issue, this has already been discussed with other editors and there has been reached a consensus in the following page: . If you're not satisfied with the consensus, feel free to discuss away. But next time, please do a little bit more research before you start pointing fingers here. Remember, we're here to help!   "

From the article:

Using time dilation under the Theory of General Relativity, for instance: 
Residing inside of a hollow, high-mass object; 

Are you sure this is accurate?  I was under the impression that according to the shell theorem, the net gravity inside a hollow, symmetrical sphere was zero.  If the hollow object isn't symmetrical, there could be some gravity inside, but in that case it would be no different from (and probably less efficient than) standing on the outside of a high-mass object.

Konitski: 
According to the 1804 Code Napoléon in vigor at the time of Chopin's birth, Chopin was born a Frenchman - now, whether you want to interpret this as a French national or a French citizen, as far as I am concerned, c'est du pareil au même: he was a Frenchman.
Chopin began travelling outside of Poland - or should we say the Duchy of Warsaw? - in 1828: Berlin; 1829, Vienna, Prague, Dresden; 1830: Dresden, Prague, Vienna; 1831: Vienna, Stuttgart, Paris. In order to travel, he needed a passport and I assume (forgive me Widipedia for assuming) that he travelled on a Polish or Duchy of Warsaw passport.  No, I have no facsimile of it, nor have I ever seen any, but without passport, Chopin could not have left Poland. 
NOTE: In Selected Correspondence of Fryderik Chopin, collected & annotated by Bornislaw Edward Sydow, translated from Polish and other languages Chopin was using in his correspondence, by Arthur Hedley, McGraw-Hill, 1963, p. 90, from what is referred to as Chopin's Album: 
Stuttgart, after 8 September 1831: ""My passport expires next month - I am not entitled to live in a foreign country - at least I have no official right...""

""I saw that no secret is hidden from him, and I mean that simply and explicitly. He knows all of the Talmud, Poskim (legal precedents) and in the Mystical works his understanding is very very deep. He is the master of light. He is a master of all the Torah. And is an expert on everything that is happening in Israel. His face shines like an angel of G-d and he himself is higher than any angel. He is the greatest Torah master in our generation and no one is even close to him. And together with this he worries for every Jew in the world.""

""Apart from MIC the gas cloud may have contained phosgene, hydrogen cyanide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen chloride, nitrous oxides and carbon dioxide, either produced in the storage tank or in the atmosphere. All these gases, except carbon dioxide, are toxic."" Carbon dioxide is toxic and significant enough levels (around 8% i think). It is just less toxic than the others. How could this be reworded so as to be clearer? Talk "

What I bone headed thing for me to have done! Regarding the category deletion nomination for Mormon Mythology and Mythological languages, initially I just felt that the categories were misapplied, but then realized it was actually an entire category that was designed to be POV.  I went back and repopulated the category so that other editors could see the thought process of the creator.  Thanks again for your note.  (talk)

This user has reverted all edits to the Zeybek dance page to the Greek version - even though he opened the article himself. 

Th etwo references taken out are there for a reason - THEY HAVE BEEN CITED. The immigrants lowest of the low article about mistreatment of Turkish immigrants in Germany influenced the Turkish hip hop genre, for example. It is all footnoted if one takes the time to read and not just edit.

This article appears to deliberately lack NPOV.  An ""alleged"" crime or a ""planned"" crime is not the same as an ""attempted"" crime.  Under U.S. law, an individual is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty.  Allowing misinformation and propaganda to creep into articles like this cheapens the entire project.  Let's work together to focus on NPOV edits, otherwise, this article should be deleted pending determination of whether or not it really happened.   "

I would like to hear your rationale for wanting to delete him. Enough material is there for a stub. Why not encourage me to write a few lines for a stub rather than outright delete it. I know in order to climb the admin ladder you have to destroy others work (Its the only way people will listen to you and therefore nominate you for adminship) but please use a little common sense - you will have to delete thousands of smaller articles before this is out. Cop on. Think before you type.

El Nino

The (limited and perhaps maladroit) changes I've made in the first bit of the article (ignoring, please, my snide comment), you may give a sense of where jargon might impede readability of the article.

However, could be a case in which ""if you have to ask"" then maybe you can't help, or maybe you can.

I've added article to ""watch list"" for the moment, and may try to marginally contribute. I don't pretend to understand subject with slightest depth, and would be cautious.

The larger problem is in its organization. 

A general reader wants to know, immediately, what are the potential consequences of El Nino. Instead, the article's lead grafs launch  into a long-winded and seemingly vague description of its history and theory that are more appropriate for deep into its body.

report me all you want. to call that ""vandalism"" is idiocy to begin with. whether it's policy or not, you're an idiot for looking for those types of things. I'm sure wikipedia is a much better place because of that (note: sarcasm). ban away!"

Even though Harryhausen is basically a special effects artist rather than a director his films are most commonly thought of as ""Ray Harryhausen films"" rather than by the director. That said, Bernard Herrmann scored four of Harryhausen's films: The 7th Voyage of Sinbad, The Three Worlds of Gulliver, Mysterious Island, and Jason and the Argonauts.
