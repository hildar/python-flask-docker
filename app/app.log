Well, the problem I keep hearing from Fox is that nowadays it is becoming extremely and continually difficult to tell what is ""news,"" even those news away from the personalities. But another problem is that information easily gets manipulated or misinterpreted in that channel and yet people still believe it.
For example, Bill O'Riley openly discredited the WWII veterans, but a few days later it read on the Fox News website that he said so otherwise! So information information put on that channel is changed according to the convenience of the personalities, whether it be in a few days or months, or years.   "

So...? What is your point? I just added ""seemed to be"" to make it more gramatically correct lol. He says: ""The violence was undoubtedly racial."" in another article. I would've put that in, but it would piss off pro-tibet people like yourself too much. Hui Muslims were attacked as well. Quite simply, in all other parts of the article, it is referenced as Tibetans and non-Tibetans. Tibetans are also of the CHinese nationality, as are Hui and Han. However, they are all their own ethnic groups. It makes no sense to the reader to just say ""Chinese immigrants"" or even ""Chinese"" since that's implying Tibet is it's own country, when it's not. Others have argued about this too in the past, and it was decided to use Tibetan and non-Tibetan because that is the most NPOV way. 216.252.71.154  "

 Are you kidding me? What does this guy have to do to have somebody shoot across his bow, once?  Murder somebody? GabeMC is out of control!! This editor has insulted many editors repeatedly. He mispells user names repeatedly, to intimidate, accuses all opposers, of his idea, as socks, calls them trolls, charges them with harrassment and is generally abusive. He incites other users to drum up charges against ""his enemies"" of this issue. He has been warned before for changing ""The"" to ""the"" in musical articles while his own launched medcom mediation is in progress, ebfore, and yet when his misbehaviour is pointed out in ANI he creates such a ruckess with sidetrack issues he gets away with more disruption and a blessing. He has had editors topic banned, adminstrators banned for a six month period and investigations into every editor that has ever disagreed with on this topic. He has disrupted many Beatles talk pages with his ""Straw Polls"" simultaneously for the same the/The issue when he doesn't get the right support. He is currently edit warring with the exact same edit, as well as a few others in the Pink Floyd article after you appear to have gave him a bigger feather in his cap for exhibiting [WP:Battleground]] behaviour for my complaint of WP:3RR.  WTF? Has we developed a Prima Donna that is untouchable, no matter what behaviour he demonstrates? A further opposing editor of his just committed WP suicide with an indef block that he requested due to the same WP:admin garbage processes.

Unspecified source for Image:Jul19169.JPG

Thanks for uploading Image:Jul19169.JPG. I notice the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you have not created this file yourself, then there needs to be a justification explaining why we have the right to use it on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you did not create the file yourself, then you need to specify where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.

If the file also doesn't have a copyright tag, then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media meets the criteria at Wikipedia:Fair use, use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use.  See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.

If you have uploaded other files, consider checking that you have specified their source and tagged them, too. You can find a list of files you have uploaded by following this link.

Thanks for uploading Image:Briefhistoryofrhyme.jpg. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under fair use, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our first fair use criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please:

 Go to the image description page and edit it to add {{Replaceable fair use disputed}}, without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template.
 On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.

Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license, or by taking a picture of it yourself.

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on [ this link]. Note that any fair use images which are replaceable by free-licensed alternatives will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion.

As this article is essentially a reconstruction of his resume, WP:RESUME would appear relevant.
Per WP:NOR#Primary, secondary and tertiary sources, articles are meant to ""be based on reliable, published secondary sources"" in order to provide ""interpretive claims, analyses, or synthetic claims"" about the topic. Lack of any such interpretive claims, analyses, or synthetic claims, is why I described the article as a ""bland and bloodless resume""  not WP:IDONTLIKEIT (as you claimed in violation of WP:AGF).

Fair use rationale for Image:TranquilityPark.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:TranquilityPark.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use.

Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

During mating the male bites the female on the back of the neck, and it is noticeable that many cats will adopt a 'ready' posture, when not in heat or even male cats, when grasped by the scruff. 62.49.6.17  
I've added this, see Cat#Skin Think outside the box 

 Scientific classification 

It appears that the current use of F. silvestris catus as the main scientific name is the result of a somewhat misguided interpretation of developments in taxonomy. I propose it is changed back to F. catus. First, this is a continuation of a lot of past discussion; most recently:
/Archive 8#Species name, and
/Archive 8#Scientific name
This discussion seems to have petered out into inactivity. It was noted that publications had started using silvestris catus, but no such citations were given. The article in its current state (under #Scientific classification) cites ICZN opinion 2027. However, as was noted in the prior discussion, this is a misinterpretation of the ruling, which was specifically aimed at wild animals and did not affect domestic animals; see this note, specifically reading from ""This erroneous nomenclature"" and the preceding paragraphs. ITIS was also cited in discussion. This clearly prefers catus as the conventional name, although it cites MWS in noting that silvestris is also a synonym.

It would therefore be much more NPOV to acknowledge F. catus as the usual name. If catus and silvestris are indeed the same species then this should be discussed under #Scientific classification. Currently, this section should have {{disputed-section|Scientific classification}} put on it, because its interpretation of the source is wrong. I would do this, but I'm a new user, so semi-protection is stopping me. It would be even better if somebody can provide a source explaining the equivalence; all the most cited, most reliable sources in this discussion so far have favoured F. catus.

Also, while this is still semi-protected, I'd like to point out that both inline citations of Mammal Species of the World should be removed. The first is uncalled for by WP:LEAD#Citations. The name ""cat"" is common knowledge and is recognised by all 62 other references in the article body. The second deals with specific species names for cat breeds. MSW doesn't even mention these names, so it's unfair to synthesise from that that Wozencraft, let alone all feline biologists, does not support them. However, MSW is a useful reference, so I suggest moving the citation to external links, or a probably-needed ""Further reading"" section.   
Works for me. My opinion last time was that we should go with whatever the reliable sources say and F. catus is now the accepted name, then so be it. ''''  {chat} 
MSW3 is the canonical listing of mammalian taxonomy. It uses Felis catus and notes there is some controversy. We should do the same. -  (talk) 
I view this with suspicion. If 's interpretation is true, then ITIS should not report the domestic dog as Canis lupus familiaris, and call Canis familiaris invalid. The ITIS webpage has no entry at all for Felis silvestris catus, not even to call it invalid. Felis silvestris catus is used more and more frequently in the scientific literature. I draw this from scholar.google.com: 
From 1982-1991, 0 uses of Felis silvestris catus, many uses of Felis silvestris f catus'' whatever that notation means.

I think that the relation between the Eldar and Japan is more tenuous then between the Eldar and Tolkien though; there are some very clear parallels between Elves and Eldar, right down to some of the naming used.

 Notes 

Notes on sources for the article:
 Too many times I have referenced sources as cited from random websites. This is because I do not have access to many of the sources firsthand; I hope you can assist here 
 Barna, p189, mentions ""7 out of 10 believers..."" but I can't view the rest of this quote in the Google Books preview...
 Lutzer is apparently mistaken when he states 8 out of 10 Americans believe the phrase appears in the Bible (p173, citing Barna, however I can't view the footnote)

Quoting In contrast, creationists, starting from the Bible, believe that God created different kinds of organisms, which reproduced ‘after their kinds’. So you start with the Bible and work back. Well as long as the end point is preconcieved I guess you don't need science. You are right about Science and Creationism going in two different directions - Science starts with the facts and looks for an answer, which in this case is most likely Evolution. Creationism starts with the answer (your reading of the Bible - I say that advisably because most Christian leaders don't agree with your interpretation) and then makes up the facts to suit. Sorry but that is how it looks.

[2022-Apr-04 19:50:59] Data: comment_text=I can see the reasoning to split, but there have been two schools of thought about this for comics.  Obviously Green Lantern or Robin are examples of a superhero name taken by several individuals, but the standard seems to be to create a 'main' article about the character name/legacy and give some details about each.  If more detail is needed/warrented, provide a link to the 'main article'.  Obviously this is also affected by the significance of the character.  Starman (comics) for instance gives descriptions of all of the many characters with that name, but only re-links to those individuals who have been notable using that psuedonym.  For Shadowhawk it seems as if the mantle of this character was passed cleanly from one person to another, so I'd say keep it all in one article as with articles such as Phantom Lady or Black Canary.

[2022-Apr-04 19:51:00] Data: comment_text=I think Serven made an error on the patent numbers, then.

The citation you removed is the US Patent Office Database  there's no way to link directly to an individual patent there, which is the reason I cited the database and included information in the footnote about how to see the patent itself. Take a look at #138  it isn't issued to Colt, it has nothing to do with guns, and it was issued in the wrong year. Then take a look at X9430: for a revolver, issued to S. Colt on Feb. 25, 1836. (For both of those, you have to enter the number of the patent you want to see, then click the option to see images  there are no transcriptions, but they have scans of the original documents.)

The link I gave above  X-Patent  discusses the patents that were destroyed. Prior to 1837 (and the fire that destroyed the patent office's copies of those first patents) patents weren't numbered. After the fire, in 1837, the Patent Office started numbering all new patents, beginning at 1. They also started trying to recover extant copies of old patents, and numbering them as they found them, but beginning with X1. So pre-fire (1836 and earlier) patents are X-series, post-fire patents don't have the X. The patent Colt was issued in 1836 was an X-series patent, because it was issued before the fire. Anything without an 'X' can't be the right patent number for that date.

When sources conflict, we need to go with the primary sources above secondary sources. And the actual scans maintained by the Patent Office are about as primary as we can get on this issue.

[2022-Apr-04 19:51:01] Data: comment_text=Telos 

I have added Telos to the home planet section of the infobox (mentioning that it was adopted) several times now and each it has been removed by the cryon user:Edoktor. Telos ought definitely to be included there as is is a massive part of who history, two episodes being set on telos itself and based around the cybermen's exploits there and at least 6 episodes featuring telosian Cybermen (the Cybermen in general featured in 10, so it was more than half. Many Cybermen were created there, there was a large cyberconversion facility, thus most Cybermen, after the tenth planet destroyed most of them, originated there and that is where the cyber controller rules from there. Thus, it is definitely a cyber-home planet and I see no possible justification for not including it on the section of the infobox. I did reference the second time so this cannot have been the issue.

Thanks for your time,

My stance of being a ""Proud Nintendo 3DS Owner"" has absolutely nothing to do with me taking a neutral position or not in the discussed article. Or can't a video game journalist for example, not have his/her personal preferences and do unbiased journalism at the same time? As for the colour code, I advise you to read the entire conversation before going in to bold assumptions. Like I said in a previous post: ""Alright, this is getting out of control. You're getting this ""Yes/No template"" thing all wrong, seriously. Someone at my talk page said the following: ""To use an extreme example: ""Does the console kill people?"", the answer is ""No"", which is a positive."". So by your philosophy would you color it with green because it's a good thing? Wrong. No, consoles do not kill people and yes, it is POSITIVE, but this does not invalidate the fact that it still is something NEGATIVE related to the question. Even the the templates themselves have by default the green color for yes and the red color for no, and that must already  mean something by itself. The purpose of Wikipedia is objectivity, not subjectivity. But what the reader does with the information is entirely up to him. Which means that if he thinks that something positive/colored green is a negative thing for him, that's his problem. He can think whatever he wants of this information. I hope this clears things up."". To sum it up: Yes=Affirmative=Green / No=Negative=Red, personal preferences don't come into account. Again, as for the Vita issue, this has already been discussed with other editors and there has been reached a consensus in the following page: . If you're not satisfied with the consensus, feel free to discuss away. But next time, please do a little bit more research before you start pointing fingers here. Remember, we're here to help!   "

From the article:

Using time dilation under the Theory of General Relativity, for instance: 
Residing inside of a hollow, high-mass object; 

Are you sure this is accurate?  I was under the impression that according to the shell theorem, the net gravity inside a hollow, symmetrical sphere was zero.  If the hollow object isn't symmetrical, there could be some gravity inside, but in that case it would be no different from (and probably less efficient than) standing on the outside of a high-mass object.

Konitski: 
According to the 1804 Code Napoléon in vigor at the time of Chopin's birth, Chopin was born a Frenchman - now, whether you want to interpret this as a French national or a French citizen, as far as I am concerned, c'est du pareil au même: he was a Frenchman.
Chopin began travelling outside of Poland - or should we say the Duchy of Warsaw? - in 1828: Berlin; 1829, Vienna, Prague, Dresden; 1830: Dresden, Prague, Vienna; 1831: Vienna, Stuttgart, Paris. In order to travel, he needed a passport and I assume (forgive me Widipedia for assuming) that he travelled on a Polish or Duchy of Warsaw passport.  No, I have no facsimile of it, nor have I ever seen any, but without passport, Chopin could not have left Poland. 
NOTE: In Selected Correspondence of Fryderik Chopin, collected & annotated by Bornislaw Edward Sydow, translated from Polish and other languages Chopin was using in his correspondence, by Arthur Hedley, McGraw-Hill, 1963, p. 90, from what is referred to as Chopin's Album: 
Stuttgart, after 8 September 1831: ""My passport expires next month - I am not entitled to live in a foreign country - at least I have no official right...""

El Nino

The (limited and perhaps maladroit) changes I've made in the first bit of the article (ignoring, please, my snide comment), you may give a sense of where jargon might impede readability of the article.

However, could be a case in which ""if you have to ask"" then maybe you can't help, or maybe you can.

I've added article to ""watch list"" for the moment, and may try to marginally contribute. I don't pretend to understand subject with slightest depth, and would be cautious.

The larger problem is in its organization. 

A general reader wants to know, immediately, what are the potential consequences of El Nino. Instead, the article's lead grafs launch  into a long-winded and seemingly vague description of its history and theory that are more appropriate for deep into its body.
